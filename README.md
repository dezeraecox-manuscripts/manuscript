# Manuscript Template Repository

Welcome to the template repository for building scientific manuscripts with version control. This template was created to efficiently setup a new Git repository when creating a scientific manuscript to be tracked with version control.

## Before you start

Using this format makes the following assumptions:

1. The experimental analyses to be included in the manuscript have their own independent github repositories, and will continue to be tracked via their own git repositories using a "manuscript" branch for development from within the data_and_analyses folder.
2. Only changes to the manuscript components are tracked via this repository, such as text and figures
3. Text drafts will be compiled in markdown, using citation support from [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

Using the complete functionality requires the following dependencies:

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - free vector graphics editor
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Microsoft Office (specifically Word for editing the reference document)

In addition, the general workflow underlying this repository was conceived to integrate with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and you may find some of the following extensions useful:

- vscode-pandoc
- Pandoc Markdown Preview
- Markdown Table Prettifier
- Excel to Markdown table
- Code Spell Checker
- Zotero citation picker
- Pandoc Citer
